        <p>Ayo, lesson here, Bey. You come at the king, you best not miss. ...Well if anybody got a problem with me spending time with y'all, I'd be much obliged to stick my gun straight in they mouth. ...All in the game yo... [laughs] All in the game. ...You still don't get it, do you? This ain't about your money, bro. Your boy gave you up. That's right. And we ain't had to torture his ass neither! Man, money ain't got no owners. Only spenders.

        </p>

        <p>The cheese stands alone. ...How you expect to run with the wolves come night, when you spend all day sparring wit' the puppies? ...Omar don't scare. ...Bird triflin', basically. Kill an everyday workin' man and all. I mean, I do some dirt, too, but I ain't never put my gun on nobody that wasn't in the game. ...I've got a bounty on my head man. Five figures! If I'd known I'd be sharing quarters with all these boys - I'd probably wouldn't have robbed so many of them. A man gotta have a code. Come on now, when have you ever known me to out my gun on someone thats not in the game?
